# YouGetMe

YouGetMe is a messenger that allows language learning in a group setting. The responsibility placed on them by their peers holds them accountable for their learning behavior and persistence. YouGetMe provides a platform for the users to message each other using a special language learning keyboard. Words are elements of this keyboard and they are arranged according to the syntax (word order) of the target language. The product is dedicated to help elementary level language learners immediately use their language knowledge in a real-life setting. In the beginning they type in messages in their native tongue exploring how those would look like in target language, but the amount of scaffolding is being reduced with time and after certain amount of clicks users must be able to recognize words they choose in the target language. This mechanics can easily be incorporated in existing digital behaviors of people — like messaging with the partner or friends.

## Topic
Language learning in a couple/group setting through a messenger.

## Problem
The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 11.4 million married couple households, or 21 percent of all married-couple households in America in 2011, had at least one spouse born in another country. The number of international couples in a globalized 21st century is constantly raising.<br><br>
21st century is a very fast-paced time. Everyone is busy. It’s hard to spare time for anything “extra”. Foreign language learning is clearly an “extra”. It takes enormous amount of dedication to spare time and energy for that activity. That’s why language learning apps are so popular compared to traditional face to face learning environments. They provide users with flexibility to learn language at the most convenient time and pace. Unfortunately, there are no apps that allow end users to learn a language with a partner. It is usually the user and the program. When the initial motivation and excitement wear off, people stop using the language learning apps because there’s nothing to hold them accountable.<br><br>
The research shows that if a couple takes on a certain activity together they are more likely to be more persistent/successful, so we suggest adding a language component into people’s daily digital behaviour — like messaging.

## Target Audience

<ul>
  <li>In a long-distance relationship</li>

  <li>With a different mother tongues</li>
</ul>

### User Stories
<b>Jessica</b> is an American, who just took a year abroad and went travelling to Europe. She fell in love with Andre and they are serious about the future together. They still haven’t figured out where they will live or how will it all work out in the future. What Jessica is sure about is that she wants to learn French to understand Andre better, since that’s his mother tongue. She googles language learning options — both face to face and online and chooses Duolinguo since it’s the most popular product on the market. She uses it for some time, but finds it annoying that she need to screenshot every time she has a question and wants to ask Anrie, so she decides to look for an alternative, focusing on collaborative learning experience, that’s how she finds lovebirds. And that a perfect fit because she is learning the language in conjunction with her communication (messenger feature) to Andre, which brings them closer together.
