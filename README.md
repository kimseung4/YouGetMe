# YouGetMe

YouGetMe is a messenger that allows language learning in a group setting. The responsibility placed on them by their peers holds them accountable for their learning behavior and persistence. YouGetMe provides a platform for the users to message each other using a special language learning keyboard. Words are elements of this keyboard and they are arranged according to the syntax (word order) of the target language. The product is dedicated to help elementary level language learners immediately use their language knowledge in a real-life setting. In the beginning they type in messages in their native tongue exploring how those would look like in target language, but the amount of scaffolding is being reduced with time and after certain amount of clicks users must be able to recognize words they choose in the target language. This mechanics can easily be incorporated in existing digital behaviors of people - like messaging with the partner or friends.

## Topic
Language learning in a couple/group setting through a messenger.

## Problem
The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 11.4 million married-couple households, or 21 percent of all married-couple households in America in 2011, had at least one spouse born in another country. The number of international couples in a globalized 21st century is constantly raising.<br><br>
21 century is a very fast-paced time. Everyone is busy. It’s hard to spare time for anything “extra”. Foreign language learning is a clear “extra”. It takes enormous amount of dedication to spare time and energy for that activity. That’s why language learning apps are so popular comparing to traditional face to face learning environments - the provide users with flexibility to learn language at the most convenient time and pace. But there are unfortunately no apps that allow to learn a language with a partner. It is usually the user and the program. When the initial motivation and excitement wear off people stop using language learning apps, because there’s noone to hold them accountable.<br><br>
The research shows that if a couple takes on a certain activity together they are more likely to be more persistent/successful, so we suggest adding a language component into people’s daily digital behaviour - like messaging.

### User Stories
<b>Jessica</b> is an American, who just took a year abroad and went travelling to Europe. She fell in love with Andre and they are serious about the future together. They still haven’t figured out where they will live or how will it all work out in the future. What Jessica is sure about is that she wants to learn French to understand Andre better, since that’s his mother tongue. She googles language learning options - both face to face and online and chooses Duolinguo since it’s the most popular product on the market. She uses it for some time, but finds it annoying that she need to screenshot every time she has a question and wants to ask Anrie, so she decides to look for an alternative, focusing on collaborative learning experience, that’s how she finds lovebirds. And that a perfect fit because she is learning the language in conjunction with her communication (messenger feature) to Andre, which brings them closer together.

<b>Jane and Nessy</b> are old friends. They were roommates in college and kept in touch through their entire life. They had kids at the same time and now 15 years later when they are off to college they both got too much free time on their hands. They decided to take on a new hobby - learn a language. Since both of them took a trip to Germany in their youth, they  decided to learn German.They taking a class in a local community college and their teacher suggests they search for apps to maximize their learning experience. Since their kids are far away and they mostly use messenger apps to communicate they feel like messaging is the mechanics they are most comfortable with. SO they google “messaging” and “language learning” and get to the lovebirds, download it and use it as a supplementary learning tool.
